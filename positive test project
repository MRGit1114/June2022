The purpose of this document is to demonstrate a series of positive tests for the Ampeg website (https://ampeg.com/index.html). A positive test is a type of testing
that is performed with the assumption that everything will work as expected. This check of certain functionality is performed to ensure that the end user (a customer, 
in this case) can make positive interactions with the site.

reproduction and further implementation into automation software such as Selenium.
