Quintrix Positive Test

Summary and Scope
The purpose of this document is to demonstrate a series of positive tests for the Ampeg website (https://ampeg.com/index.html). A positive test is a type of testing
that is performed with the assumption that everything will work as expected. This check of certain functionality is performed to ensure that the end user (a customer, 
in this case) can make positive interactions with the site. The scope of this test will be written for non-experts in QA using any product on the Ampeg website.

Test case ID
This positive test assigns a test case ID of QT (Quintrix Test), incremented numerically per test number starting with 001 (ex: QT-001).

Traceability
Tests performed in this positive test environment will contain detailed steps for reproducing each test case in order to achieve good traceability for test case
reproduction and further implementation into automation software such as Selenium.
